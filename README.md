4-In a Row 
About the game:
You and your friend chose your names and every one have a turn.
when you click on a column the first button that is gray from down will become blue(or red depend on what your color is).
If you have four the same color in a row you are the winner.
I used in this code both java script with Jquery.
Here we will use both front-end and back-end a little bit, to execute the html code.
we will use html to create our layers, make the headers and the pharagraph. 
Later on we will use css to make the buttons in the center, and make them rounded.
At the end we will use java script for the logic, and make the connection with the html file.
